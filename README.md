# Data-Processing-and-Storage
## In-Memory Key-Value Database

This project implements an in-memory key-value database in Python that supports basic operations such as `put`, `get`, `begin_transaction`, `commit`, and `rollback`. The database supports transactions, ensuring that changes made within a transaction are only visible after committing.

### How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the example usage provided in the code.

### Future Modifications
The following modifications could be made to this assignment to enhance its pedagogical value for future students:

1. Implement additional features such as support for different data types, concurrency control, or persistent storage.
3. Have students write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation or grade it based on set unit tests.
4. Add a command-line interface to prioritize user interaction
