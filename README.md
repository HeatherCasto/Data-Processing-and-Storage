# Data-Processing-and-Storage
## In-Memory Key-Value Database

This project implements an in-memory key-value database in Python that supports basic operations such as `put`, `get`, `begin_transaction`, `commit`, and `rollback`. Keys are strings and values are integers. The database supports transactions, ensuring that changes made within a transaction are only visible after committing.

### How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).
3. Run the `main.py` file to execute the example usage provided in the code.

### Future Modifications
To enhance this assignment for future iterations, consider the following modifications:

Provide more detailed error messages for better debugging.
Implement additional features such as support for different data types, concurrency control, or persistent storage.
Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
Include documentation using docstrings to describe each method and its parameters.
Improve user interaction by implementing a command-line interface or integrating with a web framework for easier usage.
